      <description>pay Requests a payment to be processed via a QR Partner.
POST /payments
This request contains conventional payment information (POS information, transaction amount, date etc.) as well as Partner information. If a merchant is unable to supply the Partner information in this request, then the request is directed to an intermediate system which also receives notifications from Partners of QR scans. This intermediate system will match the payment request from the merchant with the scan notification from the Partner using the QR code information common to both messages.</description>

      <description>The swagger (Open API) definition of the interface specification can be found here, as well as below.
Many tools are available for processing swagger files, and using a code generation tool to create a boilerplate client or server can be an excellent starting point for development. We highly recommend looking at swagger-codegen for a generator in your preferred language when starting out.
