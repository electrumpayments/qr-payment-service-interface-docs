<p>The <a href="http://swagger.io">swagger (Open API)</a> definition of the interface specification can be found <a href="/specification/swagger/swagger.yaml">here</a>, as well as below.</p>

<p>Many tools are available for processing swagger files, and using a code generation tool to create a boilerplate client or server can be an excellent starting point for development. We highly recommend looking at <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen">swagger-codegen</a> for a generator in your preferred language when starting out.</p>
